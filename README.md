This does not touch or modify the game client itself, it's really just a launcher. So don't worry, there's [no risk of being banned](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/wiki/Why-it%27s-not-reasonably-possible-for-you-to-be-banned-by-Bloxstrap) for using this.

Bloxstrap Modified is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
 ## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap Modified](https://github.com/rafaderren/bloxstrapmodified/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap Modified after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap Modified for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Bloxstrap Modified is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.
